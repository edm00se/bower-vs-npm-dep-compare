    <p>Watch it, Goldie. Hi, Marty. The storm. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.</p>

    <p>Marty you gotta come back with me. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc</p>

    <p>Never mind that now, never mind that now. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Get your meat hooks off of me. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?</p>

    <p>Ahh. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? What's that thing he's on? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Huh?</p>

    <p>Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Marty. Marty. Marty. Are you okay? What a nightmare.</p>
